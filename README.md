## Project Objectives

**Data-Driven Supply Chain Intelligence**: Analyze complex supply chain operations using advanced SQL queries to identify bottlenecks, optimize costs, and improve overall operational efficiency across suppliers, transportation modes, and product categories.

**Performance Optimization**: Extract key performance indicators including lead times, defect rates, transportation costs, and inventory levels to support strategic decision-making in supply chain management.

**Risk Assessment**: Identify high-risk areas including stockout scenarios, supplier reliability issues, and quality control challenges to enable proactive supply chain risk management.

## Database Structure

    `Number of Product Sold` INT,
    `Revenue Generated` FLOAT,
    `Customer demographics` VARCHAR(50),
    `Stock levels` INT,
    `Lead times` INT,
    `Order quantities` INT,
    `Shipping times` INT,
    `Shipping costs` VARCHAR(50),
    `Supplier name` VARCHAR(50),
    `Location` VARCHAR(50),
    `Lead time` INT,
    `Production volume` INT,
    `Manufacturing lead time` INT,
    `Manufacturing costs` FLOAT,
    `Inspection results` VARCHAR(50),
    `Defect rates` FLOAT,
    `Transportation mode` VARCHAR(50),
    `Routes` VARCHAR(50),
    `Costs` FLOAT,

## SQL Analysis Framework

### Advanced Analytical Queries
```sql
-- Transportation Mode Efficiency
SELECT `Transportation mode`, AVG(`Lead time`) AS avg_Lead_Time
FROM Supply_Chain_DB.Supply_chain_dataanalysis
GROUP BY `Transportation mode`;

-- Supplier Quality Performance
SELECT `Supplier name`, AVG(`Defect rates`) AS Avg_defect_rate
FROM Supply_Chain_DB.Supply_chain_dataanalysis
GROUP BY `Supplier name`
ORDER BY Avg_defect_rate ASC;

-- Risk Assessment Analysis
SELECT `Product type`, `Stock levels`, 
       CASE 
           WHEN `Stock levels` < 10 THEN 'High Risk' 
           WHEN `Stock levels` BETWEEN 10 AND 30 THEN 'Medium Risk'
           ELSE 'Low Risk'
       END AS stockout_risk
FROM Supply_Chain_DB.Supply_chain_dataanalysis
ORDER BY stockout_risk DESC;
```
